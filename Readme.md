# Authentication System (Frontend & Backend)

This project contains both the **frontend** and **backend** for a user authentication system. The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, and the backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**. The system allows users to register, log in, and access a protected dashboard.
